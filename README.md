# Machine Learning Practice Repository
Collection of hands-on experiments and benchmarking pipelines using XGBoost, scikit-learn, and Python.
This repo showcases my approach to building modular, reproducible workflows for supervised learning tasks, with a focus on transparency, performance, and clean code.

ðŸ“š Example Projects
- XGBoost GPU vs CPU Benchmarking (xgb_gpu_cpu.ipynb).

This project compares the training performance of XGBoost on GPU and CPU backends using a random generated dataset. Tt highlights the speedup potential of GPU acceleration(CUDA) for large-scale tabular data and provides reproducible metrics for both environments.


- Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ Kaggle Competition.

This project tackles the classic Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster Kaggle competition. The goal is to predict passenger survival using structured data and supervised learning techniques - RandomForestClassifier in my case.
