# Machine Learning Practice Repository
Collection of hands-on experiments and benchmarking pipelines using XGBoost, scikit-learn, and Python.
This repo showcases my approach to building modular, reproducible workflows for supervised learning tasks, with a focus on transparency, performance, and clean code.
